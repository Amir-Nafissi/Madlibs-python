list = """

When something is PLURAL, it means it is more than one. For example, door pluralized is doors.

A NOUN is the name of a person, a place, or a thing. An umbrella, toy, door, table, etc. 

A VERB is an action word. Run, pitch, jump, swim, etc.

An ADVERB tells how something is done. Itâ€™s a verb that usually ends with "ly." Modestly, stupidly, greedily, carefully, etc.

An ADJECTIVE describes something or someone. Soft, ugly, messy, short, etc.
